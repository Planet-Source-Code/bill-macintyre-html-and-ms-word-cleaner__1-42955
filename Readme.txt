This project was built as a GUI front end to Andre Blavier's wrapper around the TidyCom Dll.
It cleans up HTML source and is a great MS Word HTML cleaner as well.
It is also useful as a block indenting tool for HTML source.

TidyCOM is a Windows COM component wrapping Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy, a free utility
application from the World Wide Web Consortium that helps you clean up your web pages.
HTML Tidy is available from the W3C as a command-line program, à la Unix.
To better fit in the Windows environment Andre has written COM component wrapper
for Tidy available here:

The Tidy SourceForge object is here:

Notes:

You must register the attached TidyCom.dll
